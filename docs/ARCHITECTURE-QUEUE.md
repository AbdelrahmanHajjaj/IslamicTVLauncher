# Architecture migration queue

Updated: 2026-11-11 (Africa/Cairo). Owner: project owner. Execution: autonomous,
sequential, on `feature/platform-core`. Starting commit: `74a4287`.

## Resume contract

This ledger is the authoritative migration scope, decisions, queue and evidence.
Read it first; inspect only the source, applicable instructions and documentation
needed for the first actionable item. Update it before changing focus or yielding.
Work on one queue item at a time. Commit verified, reviewable increments. Do not
reconstruct scope from old chat, historical contribution plans or speculative work.
Repository safety, licensing, platform instructions and actual source still apply.
Record a material new user decision here before implementing it.

## Approved outcome

One household product, with independently buildable platform projects consuming a
portable domain core and canonical resources. Preserve current Android and old-LG
functionality and intentional platform differences, stored preferences, installed
identities, Arabic/English, RTL/LTR, accessibility and exact religious text.

- Shared core: models, validation and prayer-day/reminder product rules. Explicit
  inputs and results; no UI, filesystem, network, device APIs or background timers.
- Shared data/design: cities, methods, bilingual text, station/voice catalogs,
  existing tokens/patterns and distributable assets. Platform outputs are generated.
- Android: existing Java Views and native integrations; existing installer/recovery
  remains functional. Do not replace native UI as part of core extraction.
- webOS: existing web UI and LG service/integrations, with webOS 2.2 / WebKit 538.2 /
  Node 0.10.25 compatibility. Support newer LG through this project when validated.
- Eventual layout: `shared/{core,data,design}`, `platforms/{android-tv,webos}`,
  existing installer, site and tools. Move paths after dependency boundaries work.
- Use Kotlin Multiplatform JVM + ES5, selected by Q02's actual-host proof. The approved rewrite permits a
  narrowly scoped Kotlin core despite the inherited Java-only guidance. Adoption
  depends on measured legacy-host compatibility, size and integration evidence.
- Reuse existing adhan-java/adhan-js adapters initially. Do not rewrite astronomy.
- Keep this repository/history initially. Independent project ownership and
  distribution are intended; preserve original and third-party license notices.

## Explicitly deferred

Companion Android/iOS apps, pairing, control protocols/transports, cloud/accounts,
remote management and update delivery are outside iteration one. Pairing may remain
unsupported on some TVs. A later companion configures an already installed TV app
on the same LAN without accounts/cloud. No Apple hardware/build access exists yet.
Samsung implementation and additional platform scaffolding wait until this
foundation works. Sony Android/Google TV uses the Android project; other Sony
models need identification. No unrelated UI redesign, telemetry, ads, new feeds,
speculative plugin framework, firmware changes or root experiments.

Publishing, merging, deleting/recreating a remote repository and GitHub detachment
are separate operations; this execution does not perform them. Keep private device
state, credentials, logs, captures, binaries and restricted audio under ignored
local state. No permanent always-on development PC is a product requirement.

## Validation and completion

Old LG is available now; use configured local device tooling and distinguish
service/DOM results from human picture/sound/remote confirmation. Audible and power
tests require the platform's watcher workflow. Android TV hardware returns around
2026-11-25; automated/JVM/emulator checks may proceed now. Modern LG, Samsung and
Sony hardware are unavailable. Never label these targets hardware-validated.

Iteration one is complete only after Android/webOS consume the shared foundation,
affected regression/build/lint/generated-output checks pass, upgrades preserve
settings, and the required existing-TV hardware checks are recorded. Missing
hardware remains an open acceptance gate, not a fabricated pass. Continue
independent software work while awaiting hardware. Retain the Android APK budget
below 25,000,000 bytes; record performance measurements before claiming improvement.

## Ordered queue

| ID | State | Work and acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q00 | Done | Create branch, persistent goal and this ledger; route future migration work here. |
| Q01 | Done | Baseline: dependency/caller map, current behavior differences, executable checks/tool/media availability and performance evidence; record results without private device details. |
| Q02 | Done | Portable-core proof: shared offset/next-prayer behavior on JVM and ES5 app/service hosts; meaningful common fixtures, native-Java integration, legacy API checks, size/startup/memory evidence and actual LG probe where available; select technology with recorded rationale. |
| Q03 | Active | Canonical resource extraction: move source ownership out of Android; migrate all generators/consumers and fixtures together; verify catalog/text/token equivalence and deterministic regeneration. |
| Q04 | Queued | Core domain migration: extract settings and prayer-day rules in complete tested slices; cover date rollover, tomorrow Fajr, DST, offsets, Hijri range, unavailable calculations and deliberate platform differences. |
| Q05 | Queued | Reminder policy migration: preserve enabled/default states, expiry, deduplication, cancellation, overlap and platform lifecycle; keep OS scheduling and playback in shells. |
| Q06 | Queued | Separate platform projects/builds: migrate paths only after boundaries work; update Gradle, npm, installer, tools, generated outputs, tests and CI; add no empty future-platform projects. |
| Q07 | Queued | Ownership/documentation: update actual upstream download/support references safely, architecture/contribution/agent guidance and relevant changelog; retain attribution/notices; do not publish or detach. |
| Q08 | Queued | Full automated review and measured optimization: affected Python/Java, Android build/lint/size, preview test/build/tokens and LG ES5/service/browser checks; resolve introduced regressions and review final diff. |
| Q09 | Hardware gate | Upgrade and device acceptance on old LG and Android: preserve settings/input/startup, verify both languages/focus, prayer/media/remote/lifecycle; record exact evidence and unverified paths. Android awaits hardware. |

## Current cursor

Next: Q03.6b, shared theme definitions/preset order. Finish the Q03.6a commit if
resuming between operations, then inspect the 19 preset JSON files, 20 built-in
IDs plus Android's final custom sentinel, and every native/preview/LG caller.
Move source ownership and remove Java scraping while preserving IDs/order,
palette bytes, background/lighting defaults and custom import behavior. Update
build inputs/generators, consumer paths and checks together. Shared icons follow
themes. Restricted media stays ignored; keep existing shared token/pattern sources
and do not redesign the UI. Audit Q03 dependencies before starting Q04.
Do not move platform directories yet (Q06). Production apps retain their existing
domain implementations until Q04. Private logs/helpers are under ignored
`state/platform-core/`; do not publish them. Q02 commit: `83b0c72`.

## Evidence and decisions

- 2026-11-11: owner approved the architecture plan, durable queue, sequential full
  autonomy, feature branch and persistent goal. Companion/pairing explicitly
  deferred; unavailable pairing is acceptable. No unanswered start decision.
- Branch created from clean `main` at `74a4287`; no unrelated working-tree changes.
- Persistent goal created for this ledger's iteration-one migration. No token or
  time budget was requested. Human/hardware acceptance is part of completion.

### Q01 baseline (2026-11-11)

- Node 24.13.1, JDK 17.0.10 and Python 3.14.6 available. SDK 34 is installed; this
  session needs `ANDROID_HOME` pointing at the existing SDK. Existing Gradle cache
  and Python temporary directories require sandbox-approved execution. Initial
  permission/SDK failures were environmental; corrected runs below passed.
- Launcher APK: 20,246,215 bytes. Lint baseline: launcher 0 errors / 54 warnings;
  installer 0 errors / 14 warnings. This is the comparison baseline for this branch.
- PASS: 36 Python/Java regression tests; Android launcher size/build/lint and
  installer build/lint; preview tests, 18-page build and tokens check; LG ES5/core/
  service regressions and Arabic/English browser suite. Raw logs are ignored under
  `state/platform-core/baseline-*.log`. Browser Luna/decoder behavior is mocked.
- All 14 adhan and 12 announcement clips and site/LG npm dependencies are locally
  available; media remains ignored. No source changes resulted from generation.
- Dependencies: Android `PrayerDay` combines astronomical adapters, Android ICU
  calendar and domain selection. Its consumers include Home, All apps, Today,
  screensaver, call screen, prayer dock/watch, reminders, settings and announcements.
  LG `core.js` is consumed by app/service and tests; it also owns LG input/app rules.
  Preview has separate prayer/layout rules. Android `Prefs`, `Text`, `PrayerMethod`,
  `Radio`, `Adhans`, themes/fonts/icons feed site extraction and LG packaging.
- Preserve the intentional day-model difference: Android/preview replace the
  displayed Fajr slot after Isha, while LG keeps today's row and a separate
  tomorrow-Fajr value. New domain selection must not mutate its input times.
- No current physical-TV performance measurement was made. The configured LG CLI
  is not on this session's PATH; discover existing private device configuration
  before any hardware probe. No device was changed.
- Initial candidate was cached Kotlin 2.2.10 on Gradle 8.9 / AGP 8.5.2. Q02's
  integration evidence determined the final stable toolchain below. Source:
  https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform/multiplatform-compatibility-guide.html.

### Q02 accepted foundation (2026-11-11)

- Additive `shared/core` candidate: offset validation and nonmutating current/next
  prayer selection. Production Android/LG callers have not switched to it.
- PASS: 4 common tests on JVM and JavaScript, plus a native-Java caller test.
  PASS: ES5 parsing and 31 assertions in both browser and CommonJS VM hosts with
  modern APIs removed. Runtime JS plus its pruned Kotlin stdlib: 16,794 bytes;
  JVM core jar: 3,309 bytes. Kotlin JS test tooling uses npm and the installed Node;
  retain strict repository policy rather than adding Node/Yarn download repositories.
- Existing paired LG profile recovered through local CLI config. Isolated files
  were uploaded, checked and removed; installed source/preferences/schedules were
  not changed. Inspector forwarding was closed after each bounded evaluation.
- PASS on actual LG Node 0.10.25: 31 assertions; one-run load 32 ms, checks 20 ms;
  RSS 9,867,264 -> 10,240,000 bytes. PASS on actual WebKit 538.2: 31 assertions in
  CommonJS and real browser-UMD modes; storage/focus unchanged and temporary globals
  restored. Browser-UMD load/check: 7/18 ms (warm proof). These are tiny proof
  measurements, not app performance claims. Private JSON evidence:
  `state/platform-core/lg-core-proof.json`, `lg-webkit-proof.json` and
  `lg-webkit-browser-proof.json`.
- Selected Kotlin 2.2.10. Required stable tool correction: AGP 8.10.1 + Gradle
  8.11.1 (official distribution SHA256 pinned; wrapper regenerated with the wrapper
  task). The previous AGP lint could not read metadata; no suppression or
  experimental lint override remains. Java 17 and app SDK levels are unchanged.
  Sources: Android Kotlin-support table and
  https://developer.android.com/build/releases/agp-8-10-0-release-notes.
- PASS: clean linked-core APK/lint, installer build/lint, then clean normal APK/
  lint and complete `:core:check`. Reject hidden metadata diagnostics even if a
  Gradle task exits zero. Clean normal APK: 20,066,700 bytes, no core/Kotlin runtime
  descriptors, runtime dependency graph remains adhan-java only. Clean trial APK:
  20,903,595 bytes with core/runtime descriptors; incremental cost 836,895 bytes,
  under 25,000,000. Trial injection is ignored tooling, not a source dependency.
  Use clean paired measurements; mixed incremental trial builds retained stale
  dex content and produced misleading sizes. Final logs: `foundation-final.log`
  and `android-core-final.log`; artifact inspections: `*-apk-inspection.json`.
- New lint reports 0 errors and 55/15 warnings, versus the old-engine 54/14.
  The extra recommendations concern Gradle 8.14.6 availability and installer
  compileSdk 35 availability. Q08 must resolve/assess these explicit tool findings;
  do not claim warning-count equivalence or lower the final quality gate silently.
- Core CI runs common JVM/JS, Java interop and ES5 checks. App CI watches shared
  sources and Gradle properties. Keep generated artifacts/media/private helpers
  ignored and retain the generated Kotlin JS npm test lockfile.
- On later production adoption, package the Kotlin runtime's Apache-2.0 notices
  in the actual Android/LG artifacts and update third-party documentation. Android
  hardware integration/performance and complete LG UI/service acceptance remain
  Q09 gates; this proof is not a user-facing platform migration.

### Q03.1 canonical cities and regions (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/{cities,regions}.json` exactly preserves the previous 137 cities,
  43 countries, six regions, ordering, identifiers, bilingual labels, coordinates,
  methods and Hanafi flags. No new city or timetable claim. Old/new comparison
  snapshots are ignored under `state/platform-core/{cities,regions}-before.json`.
- `tools/catalogs.mjs` validates catalogs and generates Android `CityCatalog.java`;
  `Prefs.City`, `Prefs.CITIES`, `Prefs.REGIONS`, fallback and persisted keys stay
  compatible. Preview/LG read canonical JSON directly; obsolete ignored copies
  were removed so stale imports cannot silently work. Generator check is in site CI.
- PASS: generator input rejection and complete Java field/order round-trip;
  exact pre-migration JSON comparison; actual compiled `Prefs`/`CityCatalog` JVM
  initialization and every field/region versus canonical JSON (private helper
  `state/platform-core/check-city-runtime.py`).
- PASS: 36 Python/Java regressions; Android/installer build/lint/size; preview
  tests and 18-page build, data and token checks; LG ES5/service and Arabic/English
  browser regressions. Raw `cities-*.log` evidence is ignored. No TV deployment:
  LG data values and renderer behavior are unchanged; browser media/Luna are mocked.
- Developer guidance now points to canonical cities/regions and regeneration.
  Remaining catalog extraction is still Q03, not a completed platform migration.
- Verified city slice committed as `761dace`; working tree is clean at this
  checkpoint except subsequent ledger notes. Continue Q03.2 without redoing Q01/Q02.

### Q03.2 canonical methods (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/methods.json` owns all 19 ordered IDs, bilingual names, nine custom
  presets and Turkey's `[0,-7,5,4,7,0]` corrections. Android enum is generated from
  its native adapter template; native/preview labels use metadata. Preview/LG read
  canonical JSON; old generated method copies and Java scraping were removed.
- Original built-in factories/tags stay in adapters. JS Turkey keeps its factory
  and canonical overrides; Java custom parameters remain equivalent. No astronomy
  rewrite or saved-method change. Corrections remain independent per calculation.
- PASS: input validation, 19 frozen JS parameter sets (including factory identity),
  ID order, bilingual labels/fallback, 76 native minute-rounded prayer-day outputs
  before/after, and 76 exact LG daily outputs versus the pre-migration snapshot.
  Public regression baseline: `tests/fixtures/method-parameters.json` (adhan-js
  4.4.6). Private snapshot helpers/results are under `state/platform-core/`.
- PASS: 36 native/Python regressions, Android/installer build/lint/size, preview
  tests/build/data/token checks, LG ES5/service and bilingual browser suite. Raw
  `methods-*.log` evidence is ignored. No TV deployment or audible test was needed.
- Context7 lacked adhan-js coverage; installed 4.4.6 source and primary Batoul Apps
  CalculationMethod/PrayerTimes sources were checked before changing adapters.

### Q03.3 canonical radio (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/stations.json` owns all 16 entries, retaining exact IDs/order, URLs,
  bilingual names/locations and broadcast/reciter flags. Android's generated
  `RadioCatalog` feeds the unchanged `Radio.Station`/selection/playback interface.
  Preview/LG read JSON directly; both old Java-scraping passes were deleted and
  the obsolete ignored preview JSON was removed.
- PASS: catalog input rejection (identities/labels/flags/URLs), full generated Java
  round-trip and exact canonical/packaged-LG equality against the old snapshot.
  All preview tests and 18-page build, data/token checks, Android size/build/lint,
  LG ES5/service and bilingual browser regressions pass. Evidence: ignored
  `state/platform-core/radio-*.log` and `stations-before.json`.
- No playback, TV deployment or codec/TLS/hardware claim. Existing saved station
  keys and Cairo fallback are unchanged. Installer/core logic was unaffected;
  their suites were not repeated for this catalog-only increment.

### Q03.4 canonical adhan voices (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/voices.json` owns the 14 ordered IDs/bilingual names and original
  download filenames. Generated `VoiceCatalog` preserves the `Adhans.VOICES` API;
  preview/LG consume canonical metadata. The two Java-scraping paths and obsolete
  ignored preview JSON were removed. Playback/default preference keys are untouched.
- The Bash/curl fetcher reads generated `tools/adhan-sources.tsv`, retaining its
  existing prerequisites and exact URLs without needing Node at download time.
  Rights status and ignored audio policy are unchanged.
- PASS: malformed metadata rejection, generated Java/TSV fidelity, exact labels/
  ordering/source filenames against old snapshots, packaged LG metadata and all
  14 MP3 hashes. Bash syntax and all 14 mocked downloads passed; a second run skipped
  existing files. Initial Bash sandbox signal-pipe denial was environmental; the
  approved isolated run passed without network requests.
- PASS: preview tests/18-page build/data/tokens, Android size/build/lint and LG
  ES5/service/bilingual browser suites. Private evidence: ignored `voices-*.log`,
  `voices-before.json`, `fetch-adhans-before.sh` and `voice-fetch-check/`. No TV
  deployment, audible check or recording download. Unaffected installer/core suites
  were not repeated in this increment.

### Q03.5a canonical plain bilingual text (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/strings.json` owns 174 plain string/list templates. Android's
  `Text.java` is generated from `Text.java.template`; remaining formatting logic
  stays in the template. Preview/LG read canonical JSON directly; Java scraping
  and the obsolete ignored preview JSON were removed. Validation covers language
  types, list lengths, parameters, digit flags and adapter markers.
- Existing difference preserved explicitly: the web extractor compacted repeated
  whitespace in `saved` and `roomKeys`; Android kept it. Canonical text preserves
  native spacing and each web adapter compacts literals before filling parameters.
  No visible labels, religious content, preference keys or UI layouts were changed.
- PASS: frozen pre-extraction JVM hashes, covering 1,392 outputs across 174 methods,
  Arabic/English, both digit modes, sample/null parameters and independent arrays.
  PASS: 1,392 preview outputs and all packaged LG entries against the old snapshot.
  Frozen public hashes live in `tests/fixtures/text-output-hashes.json`; private
  `Text-before.java`, `strings-before.json` and extraction proof remain ignored.
- PASS: all 37 Python/Java regressions, catalog input rejection/generated checks,
  preview tests/18-page build/tokens, Android size/build/lint (APK 20,248,190 bytes),
  LG ES5/service and bilingual browser suite. Logs: ignored `strings-*.log`.
  Unaffected installer/shared-core suites were not repeated. No TV deployment,
  sound/picture check or performance-improvement claim.

### Q03.5b canonical formatter copy (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/format-text.json` owns 102 locale-specific literals: significant
  prefix/suffix spaces, labels, directions and grammatical forms. Language-only
  forms (such as Arabic ordinals) retain their actual scope. Compile-time markers
  generate native constants directly; formatting/selection logic stays native.
  Preview helpers and matching LG copy read the same catalog. Different LG copy
  remains in its shell; no UI wording or supported controls were changed.
- Captured unchanged-source native/preview edge-case hashes before extraction.
  PASS: both native text baselines, preview formatter hashes, and 2,128 preview
  settings row sets versus the original adapter. Coverage includes plural minute
  thresholds, null/empty values, extreme signed numbers, radio states, method
  angles, both languages/digit styles and compass-sector boundaries.
- PASS: 38 Python/Java tests, catalog validation/complete native marker coverage,
  preview tests/build/data/tokens, Android size/build/lint and LG ES5/service/
  bilingual browser checks. Evidence: ignored `format-*.log`, `Text-format-before.java`
  and `format-*-before.*` / `format-*-baseline.ts`. Frozen public hashes live in
  `tests/fixtures/{text-format,site-text-format}-hashes.json`.
- No TV deployment or media test; unaffected installer/core suites were not repeated.

### Q03.5c canonical sacred UI text (2026-11-11)

- `shared/data/sacred-text.json` owns the exact existing An-Nisa 4:103 three-line
  verse and adhan call. Generated `SacredText` constants feed all three native
  callers. Preview/LG insert escaped text; the footer joins the same verse with
  spaces. Text, diacritics, line layout, Arabic direction and font styles remain
  unchanged in either UI language. No recording or religious-content addition.
- PASS: every pre-migration renderer matched before extraction; frozen UTF-8 hashes,
  generated native constant round-trip and malformed-text rejection. PASS: all 18
  built preview pages, including 10 arches/two call screens and every footer,
  preserve exact text/direction. The private HTML check handles Astro's scoped
  attributes; its initial bare-`br` matcher was corrected, not the renderer.
- PASS: preview tests/build/data/tokens, Android size/build/lint, LG ES5/service.
  The extraction commit `6f84c1c` prematurely recorded a browser pass: its new
  `innerText` assertion failed when an existing layout hid the verse. Corrective
  exact-DOM checks now pass independently of visibility, and the full bilingual
  browser suite passed on rerun before the correction commit. APK: 20,248,232 bytes.
  Logs/helpers: ignored `sacred-*.log`, `sacred-before.json` and
  `check-sacred-built.cjs`. Public baseline: `tests/fixtures/sacred-text-hashes.json`.
- Astro's official Context7 documentation confirmed escaped expressions and
  `Fragment` mapping (docs.astro.build/en/reference/astro-syntax/). No new runtime
  dependency. No TV deployment or human picture/sound check; unaffected native
  Python/installer/core suites were not repeated for this constant-only slice.

### Q03.6a shared fonts and notices (2026-11-11)

- Seven unchanged TTFs now live in `shared/design/resources/font/`; the three
  existing full OFL notices moved from LG into `shared/design/assets/licenses/`.
  Android adds shared resource/asset directories to its main source set, keeping
  every `R.font` name with no extra task or Node prerequisite. Preview/LG source
  fonts directly from the shared tree. LG still packages only its three regular
  fonts. Font/CSS selections, weights, shaping and UI geometry are unchanged.
- All actual artifacts now include the three notices: Android `assets/licenses`,
  LG `app/licenses`, preview `licenses`. Notices remain byte-identical; the new
  generated preview copies are ignored. Attribution/source paths were updated.
- PASS: clean Android size/build/lint (20,073,354-byte APK), exact pre/post APK
  font names/hashes, all shared/preview/LG font hashes, and every artifact's three
  notice hashes. Evidence: ignored `fonts-before.json`, `fonts-artifacts.json`
  and `fonts-*.log`. The lower clean APK size is not an optimization claim.
- PASS: preview tests/18-page build/data/tokens and LG ES5/service/bilingual browser
  regressions. No new behavior tests were added for byte-preserving file moves.
  Unaffected Python/installer/core suites and physical-TV checks were not repeated.
- Context7 official Gradle/Android source-set documentation checked before build
  changes. Direct resource directories avoided an unnecessary generated-copy task.
